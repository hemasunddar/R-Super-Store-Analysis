# Introduction

# Kaggle sales dataset was downloaded from: 
#<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishanshrivastava28/superstore-sales>
# It originally contains 9,995 rows of retail sales transactions.
#To simplify analysis and avoid console output truncation 
#(where only 47 rows display and the rest are omitted),
#the dataset was reduced to a subset of 50 rows.
#This data set cointains row id, order.date,shiping.date,segment, state, region,
#category,sub.category,sales, Quantity, discount, profit.
#Data Cleaning like Missing values in Quantity and Sales were identified and replaced with column means.
#Rows with missing Profit values were removed.
#Date Processing: Order dates were converted to date format, and new columns like Year,
#Month, and Weekday were created using the lubridate package.
#adding a colunu A Performance column was created to classify records as “High” or “Low” based on average profit.



#Loaded installed packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

# import the data from your saved locations
sales <- read.csv("~/Superstoresass2.csv")
View(sales)
head(sales)
tail(sales)

#### data cleaning
#1) Show & count all missing values using is.na() and sum(is.na()).

is.na(sales)

sum(is.na(sales$Quantity))# count all missing values

#2) Replace NA in Quantity and sales with column mean. 

sales$Quantity <- as.numeric(sales$Quantity)
sales$Quantity[is.na(sales$Quantity)] <- mean(sales$Quantity, na.rm = TRUE) # replace NA in QUantity column

sales$sales <- as.numeric(sales$sales)
sales$sales[is.na(sales$sales)] <- mean(sales$sales, na.rm = TRUE) # replace NA in sales column

#sales$Discount <- as.numeric(sales$Discount)
#sales$Discount[is.na(sales$Discount)] <- mean(sales$Discount, na.rm = TRUE)

print(sales)

#3) Drop rows where Profit is NA.

rows_before <- nrow(sales)
print(rows_before) # before cleaning the NA in Profit

profit_rows <- na.omit(sales$Profit) # removing the NA Values in Profit
print(profit_rows)

# Extra drop rows where discount is NA
#rows_beforeDis <- na.omit(sales$Discount)
#print(rows_beforeDis)

#4) Show number of rows before and after cleaning. 

rows_after <- nrow(sales)
print(rows_after)# after cleaning

####Date Features with lubridate 
#1) Convert Date column to Date type 

sales$Order.Date <- dmy(sales$Order.Date)
print(sales$Order.Date)

#2) Add columns: Year, Month (label), Weekday (label). 

sales$year <- year(sales$Order.Date)
print(sales$year)# created a year column

sales$month <- month(sales$Order.Date, label = TRUE)
print(sales$month) # created a month column

sales$weekday <- wday(sales$Order.Date, label = TRUE)
print(sales$weekday) # created a weekday column

# 3) Find : Month with highest revenue, Day with lowest average units sold
# Month with highest revenue
month_highest.revenue <- sales %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(Totalprofit = sum(Profit)) %>% arrange(desc(Totalprofit)) %>% head(1)
print(month_highest.revenue)

# Day with lowest average Quantity
day_avg.Quantity <- sales %>% summarise(avgQuantity = mean(Quantity)) %>% arrange(avgQuantity) %>% head(1)
print(day_avg.Quantity)

#### Loops & Conditional Logic
#1) Use a for loop to print monthly profile totals.

monthly_profits <- sales %>% summarise(totalprofit = sum(Profit))
for(i in 1:nrow(monthly_profits)){
  print(paste("Total profit in", monthly_profits$Month[i], ":", monthly_profits$totalprofit[i]))
}

#2) Create Performance column :"High" if Profit > avg profit, "Low" 
avg_profit <- mean(sales$Profit)
sales$performance <- ifelse(sales$Profit > avg_profit, "High","Low")
print(sales$performance)
####Grouping, Aggregation & Custom Function
# 1.1) Total Sales by Region
region_sales <- aggregate(Profit ~ Region, data = sales, sum)
print(region_sales)

#1.2) Average Sales by Category
category_avg <- aggregate(Profit ~ Category, data = sales, mean)
print(category_avg)

#1.3) Region with highest average profit
region_avg_sales <- aggregate(Profit ~ Region, data = sales, mean)
print("Region with highest average Profit:")
print(region_avg_sales[which.max(region_avg_sales$Profit), ])

#2) Write a function region_report

region_report <- function(State) {
  region_data <- sales[sales$Region == State, ]
  total_sales <- sum(region_sales$Profit)
  
  Category_sales <- aggregate(Profit ~ Category, data = region_data, sum)
  top_Category <- Category_sales[which.max(Category_sales$profit), ]
  
  high_days <- region_data$Date[region_sales$Profit > region_avg_sales]
  
  print(paste("Report for region:", State))
  print(paste("Total sales:", total_sales))
  print("Top selling Category:")
  print(top_Category)
  print("Dates with above-average sales:")
  print(high_days)
}
# Example 
#region_report("Central")
#region_report("East")
#region_report("South")
region_report("West")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo= FALSE}
#1) Bar Chart: Region vs Profit

ggplot(sales, aes(x = Region, y = Profit))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green")+
  ggtitle("Total Profits by Region")+
  theme_minimal()

#2) Line Chart: Date vs Profits

ggplot(sales, aes(x = Order.Date, y = Profit)) +
  geom_line(colour = "red") +
  ggtitle("Daily Profit Trend")+
  theme_minimal()

#3) tacked Bar Chart: Category vs sales (fill = Performance)

ggplot(sales, aes(x = Category, y = sales, fill = performance ))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  ggtitle("Sales by Category and performance")+
  theme_minimal()


# Conclusion

# From analyzing the Superstore dataset (subset of 50 rows),I observe 
#1) Monthly Profit Patterns we can observe One specific month contributed the highest total profit,
#indicating a potential seasonal sales peak. This insight can help plan marketing and 
#inventory strategies for that period.and another month which is to focus on it because it s showing losses
#2) The West region has emerged as the highest profit generating area'
#3) we identified individual sales contributing strongly to overall profitability.
#Because of the creating new column like performance and it has high and low categrioes
#4) Visualizations with ggplot2 
# 1.Bar charts clearly showed regional differences in profit.
# 2.Line charts displayed day-to-day profit fluctuations.
# 3.Stacked bar charts revealed category-wise sales contributions, 
#highlighting how product categories align with performance levels.

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
